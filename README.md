## Notes

- Most of the exercises are taken from practice websites, and all credits related to these pages can be found in the corresponding README.md file for each exercise.
- You may notice that there are two or more solutions for the same problem in some cases. This occurs because one solution involves manual steps (sometimes hard-coded and not following best practices) while the other adheres to good practices.
